# TODO

- Better logic to get provider name (current brute force may fail).
- Better logic to find best provider (provider that has subs and has more episodes) (how?).
- Get MAL ID using reference to MAL on main page to make inner join and ignore obscure anime.
- Try to remove duplicate links using prefix of link str (should be the same).
- Regex to try guessing the actual episode number (how to deal with seasons?).
